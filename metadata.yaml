description: What would you do if the sister with whom you had spent your whole life
  was suddenly whisked away by a suitor? That's exactly the fate that befalls a certain
  Miss Harding, the eccentric heroine at the center of The Lady of the Basement Flat.
  Dedicating herself to charitable acts carried out under the cloak of anonymity,
  Miss Harding is able to find some measure of happiness -- when suddenly, love turns
  her whole world upside down.
